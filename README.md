- 👋 Hi, I’m @error-bear! You can call me Erin if you like. 
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a technical writer within the next two years or so.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Markdown and Jekyll in my own free time, and am experimenting with Git and the like. In the next year, I'd like to learn more about Back-End programming, but that might take some time. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects for the time being. In particular, I'm fascinated with Linux documentation, particularly documentation for working with the ArchLinux OS, and might try that sometime if I get the opportunity.
- 📫 You can reach me at practicalerrors@gmail.com
- As I expand things, look for things like my LinkedIn profile, my writing portfolio, and my blog!
