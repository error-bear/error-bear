- 👋 Hi, I’m @error-bear! You can call me Erin if you like. 
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a technical writer within the next two years or so.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate my programming skills with my sizeable writing experience. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects for the time being. In particular, I'm fascinated with Linux documentation, particularly documentation for working with the ArchLinux OS, and might try that sometime if I get the opportunity.
- 📫 You can reach me at practicalerrors@gmail.com if the urge strikes.
